knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

if binary (e.g. presence/absence or success/failure or survive/die) then logistic family
if fraction (0-1) is a ratio of counts then logistic family
if fraction (0-1) is a ratio continous variables then beta family
if count then poisson family, or quasi-poisson or negative binomial
if continous but variance increases with mean then gamma family
if lognormal then gamma(link=identity)
