Fig 3 is a good candidate for a target analysis

Fig 1b very nice paired t-test
Fig 2a 3 x 1 control, cold, E (control vs two stimulators of effect)
Fig 2b a difference in significance is not necessarily signifcant
Fig 3a - nice longitudinal (body T v time) with E(baseline diff) = 0
fig 3b,c,d -  t-tests
fig 3e 2 x 1 multiple response
fig 3f 3 x 1 multiple response - good example of multiple testing - adjusting within each 3 x 1 vs. adjusting for multiple tests
fig 3h longitudinal
fig 3i t-test of fig 3h
Fig 4F,G - 3 x 1 with both treatments similar
