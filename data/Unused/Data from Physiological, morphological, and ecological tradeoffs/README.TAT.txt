Data Description: Histograms representing the proportion of time a tag spent in 12 temperature bins define in 2C increments between 4C and 24C TAT histograms were returned by Argos satellites from SPOT5 tags produced by Wildlife Computers. TAT were collected in 6-hour sampling periods, and sampling periods were programmed to begin at 01:00, 07:00, 13:00, or 21:00 local time, so that the majority (>80%) of sampling of each TAT histogram fell  within either daytime or nighttime. TAT histograms that were translated into units of depth using the hydrographic data and interpolation methods detailed in Joyce et al. (2016).
