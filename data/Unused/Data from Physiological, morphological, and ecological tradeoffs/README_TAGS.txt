Project Name: Bahamas deep-diving toothed whale telemetry and dive behavior

Date Range: 2009 to 2014

Subject: Movements and dive behaviors of deep-diving toothed whales in the Bahamas

Region: Channels of the Northern Bahama Archipelago in the Sub-tropical North Atlantic

Data Description: A summary of tagged individuals. The variables DURATION_MAX and IDDI_MED were calculated from the behavior log returned by Argos satellites from SPLASH (Mk10a) transmitter tags produced by Wildlife Computers. The variable MASS_MED was calculated from models of body mass as a function of standard length. The variable MB derived from a variety of literature sources.
