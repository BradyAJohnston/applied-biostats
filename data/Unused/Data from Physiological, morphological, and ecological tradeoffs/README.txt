Project Name: Bahamas deep-diving toothed whale telemetry and dive behavior

Date Range: 2009 to 2014

Subject: Movements and dive behaviors of deep-diving toothed whales in the Bahamas

Region: Channels of the Northern Bahama Archipelago in the Sub-tropical North Atlantic

Data Description: A table of species used to implement a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) inter-specific comparative analysis. Aside from the five species tagged in this study maximum dive duration (Tmax) and inter-deep-dive interval (IDDI) as well as body mass (m) and myoglobin concentration ([Mb]) derive from literature-reported values or were extracted from supplemental materials.
